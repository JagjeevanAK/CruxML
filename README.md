# CruxML

**The crux of machine learning â€” a minimal PyTorch-like deep learning library.**

CruxML is a lightweight reimplementation of core PyTorch concepts, built for learning, experimentation, and rapid prototyping. It offers a simple, readable codebase focused on tensors, autograd, and basic neural network components.

## Features

- NumPy-based tensor operations
- Automatic differentiation (autograd)
- Minimal neural network module system
- Clean, educational code structure

## Installation

```bash
pip install cruxml
```
